# GraphNN
The goal of GraphNN is to provide an intuitive front end UI for building non-trivial graph structure in neural networks. The goal is to be able to incorporate training/validation/deployment and parallelization functionality into a simple UI for drag and drop "click-to-train". 

Below is a sample screen shot of the UI in its current development stage.

### Timeline
* Develop basic UI
* Integrate with Server
* Provide Automated Metrics (Eg Learning curves, Accuracy, F1 etc...)
* TBC
